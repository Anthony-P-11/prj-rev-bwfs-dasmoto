# prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto

In my version of the project "Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts" I used Brackets to edit this project, and it's my first time using GitHub to submit a project. I sought to not only recreate the webpage as directed from the spec sheet, but also optimize it for W3C accessibility standards by incorporating tags and descriptors within each image and on the webpage as a whole.

Within the folder I submitted, I also included the images that were used to create the page. The links within the code are URL links to the images, so the images should show up away from my local PC.

Please let me know if I missed something that would make this better for W3C standards, I am striving to incorporate accessibility best practices into my coding workflow.
